# Workshop Dycops 2025: Nonlinear model predictive control for anything
This is the repository for the hands-on part of the workshop on approximate NMPC presented at the Dycops 2025.
## Instruction for usage in Colab (Requires an existing Google account):

Make sure to be logged in into your Google account before opening one of he notebooks. In our experience it also helps to already started Colab once
beforehand in your Webbrowser. If the Jupyter notebook appears you are already setup for the session.

## Instruction for local usage:
If for some reason, you cannot use the colab ressources you can download this repository and run the jupyter notebooks locally. For this, you will need
to set up a virtual environment either via Pip or Anaconda and install the packages required for the notebooks (if time permits I will add a requirements.txt). 
As this requires a lot of setup, it is not the preferred way and only a backup solution.
